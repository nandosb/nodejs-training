Introduction

This is a collection of small apps created for the sake of learning some foundational pieces of node.js (and extra packages)
I rely on Docker to access to node.js interpreter, thus if you clone this repo you should not have environmental issues running the examples. The only pre-requisite is to have Docker installed in your machine

************
Instructions

2. run docker -v to make sure you have docker installed

3. go to the directory where you cloned the code

4. run docker build -t basic-node-image .
